* the visitor pattern : we will make the carcontroller public and using the visitor pattern we can attach or detach the EnginBoost visitor whenever the car runs over a certain area on the road .

Aaron's Work: 
- Singleton Pattern: setup GameData script for tracking and managing game data (track times, current level, maybe powerups?)

- Decorator Pattern: setup system for attaching/detaching Projectile powerup to & from player, setup ProjectileSpawn system for when the powerup is used

- Object Pooling: Pick some props to add as possible obstacles on the track, setup spawning across the track 

- State Pattern: Create "Start" and "Stop" States for beginning & ending track, Stop should prevent user input, Start should start the race & start allowing user input => Done!

- Observer Pattern: rework to be more compatible with main premise of Observer Pattern (decoupling scripts from each other) => Done!
