* the visitor pattern : we will make the carcontroller public and using the visitor pattern we can attach or detach the EnginBoost visitor whenever the car runs over a certain area on the road .

Aaron's Work: 
- Singleton Pattern: setup GameData script for tracking and managing game data (track times, current level, maybe powerups?)

- Decorator Pattern: setup system for attaching/detaching Projectile powerup to & from player, setup ProjectileSpawn system for when the powerup is used

- Object Pooling: Pick some props to add as possible obstacles on the track, setup spawning across the track 

- State Pattern: Create "Start" and "Stop" States for beginning & ending track, Stop should prevent user input, Start should start the race & start allowing user input => Done!

- Observer Pattern: rework to be more compatible with main premise of Observer Pattern (decoupling scripts from each other) => Done!



Ons's work :
-visitor Pattern : - when you click on the button engine boost it will it will make the car go faster for 3 seconds and then the drive acceleration will go back to the normal value 500.0f , and if you press multiple times on the button it will disappear because you are not allowed to have a lot of boosts at the same time , so i set a time = 6 seconds between each boost 
when you go on a boostArea the car runs fast #

-Observer Patter : setup a system to watch when the car hits any obstacle , the camera shakes 

- Decorator Pattern: to decorate the car with a weapon that shoots the obstacles

-Singleton Pattern : I have created a Controller that makes sure that when you don't reach the end of the map/track before the timer ends  you will be taken to an other scene  => Done!
